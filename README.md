# üí´ About Me:
Hi there! I'm Naman, and I'm a machine learning and AI enthusiast with a passion for web development. I'm currently learning how to apply machine learning and AI to web development projects using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js).<br><br>I've always been fascinated by the power of technology and its ability to change the world for the better. As I delved deeper into the field of machine learning and AI, I realized how much potential there is for these technologies to revolutionize the way we live and work.<br><br>In my journey to learn more about machine learning and AI, I've gained experience in a number of technologies and tools. Here are some of the technologies I know:<br><br>Python: I've worked extensively with Python and its machine learning and AI libraries, including TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn.<br>JavaScript: I've used JavaScript to build web applications and integrate machine learning and AI models into web development projects.<br>MongoDB: I've used MongoDB to store and manage data in web applications.<br>Express.js: I've used Express.js to build REST APIs and backend servers for web applications.<br>React: I've used React to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces for web applications.<br>Node.js: I've used Node.js to build backend servers and run JavaScript code on the server side.<br>I'm always looking to learn more and explore new technologies, and I'm excited to continue building projects and contributing to the tech community. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or want to chat about machine learning, AI, or web development!
